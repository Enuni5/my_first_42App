# MY first 42App
My first application with the 42 school API

We are going to use nodjs and express.

First step is install nodejs at the iMac machines at school:
```
	brew install nodejs
```

While it's installing, we go ahead and create a github repository. Then we'll create a project with nodejs:

```
npm init
```
Choose all default options.

Then, install express framework:

```
npm install express --save
```
